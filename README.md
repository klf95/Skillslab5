The code we created takes the name and then a percent from the user.  With the percent, the program will multiply it by .01 and print the user's name and the decimal value for the percent. 
We created this code in order to help people not have to struggle through the task of converting percentages back to decimal form.  
in order to install our device, launch a terminal and type in "git clone https://github.com/klf95/Skillslab5.git".  This will download the contents inside our github and allow you to access our code. 
We chose the GNU General Public License because we care about sharing and being able to receive feedback and improvements from whomever would like to help.  the GNU General Public License allows us to do that while still keeping our code safe.
